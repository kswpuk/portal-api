  Dear {{name}},
</p>

<p>
  You have been an inactive KSWP member for almost 2 years, and as such your KSWP Portal account will be deleted on <strong>{{deletionDate}}</strong>.
  We do this to avoid holding on to your details unneccesarily, and to ensure our membership lists are an accurate reflection of our current membership.
</p>

<p>
  If you wish to become an active member of the KSWP, you can renew your membership before the date above by logging on to the <a href="https://{{portalDomain}}">KSWP Portal</a> and paying your membership online.
  Active members are expected to attend at least 2 events per year.
</p>

<p>
  If you don't wish to become an active member of the KSWP at this time, then you can always apply to join the KSWP again at a later date once your account has been deleted.
</p>

<p>
  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with a member of the KSWP Committee.
</p>

<p>
  Yours in Scouting,<br />
  KSWP
