<p>Dear {{name}},</p>

<p>
  Your KSWP Membership will expire in 28 days, on <strong>{{expiryDate}}</strong>.
  If you wish to continue as an active member of the KSWP, please renew your membership by logging on to the <a href="https://{{portalDomain}}">KSWP Portal</a> and paying your membership online.
  Active members are expected to attend at least 2 events per year.
</p>

<p>
  If you let your membership lapse, you will become an inactive member and will not be able to attend any KSWP events.
  Inactive members can renew their membership at any time in the 2 years after they become inactive,
  after which we will remove your details from our records and you will need to reapply if you wish to join the KSWP again.
  If you wish for us to remove your details before then, please get in touch.
</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with a member of the KSWP Committee.</p>

<p>Yours in Scouting,<br />KSWP</p>
