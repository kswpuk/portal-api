  Dear {{name}},
</p>

<p>
  You have been an inactive KSWP member for over 2 years, and as such your KSWP Portal account has been deleted.
  We do this to avoid holding on to your details unneccesarily, and to ensure our membership lists are an accurate reflection of our current membership.
</p>

<p>
  You may re-apply to join the KSWP again at any time, via the <a href="http://www.kswp.org.uk">KSWP Website</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with a member of the KSWP Committee.
</p>

<p>
  Yours in Scouting,<br />
  KSWP
