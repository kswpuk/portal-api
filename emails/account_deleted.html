  Dear {{name}},
</p>

<p>
  You have been an inactive QSWP member for over 2 years, and as such your QSWP Portal account has been deleted.
  We do this to avoid holding on to your details unneccesarily, and to ensure our membership lists are an accurate reflection of our current membership.
</p>

<p>
  You may re-apply to join the QSWP again at any time, via the <a href="http://www.qswp.org.uk">QSWP Website</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with a member of the QSWP Committee.
</p>

<p>
  Yours in Scouting,<br />
