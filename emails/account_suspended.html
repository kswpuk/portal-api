  Dear {{name}},
</p>

<p>
  We regret to inform you that your KSWP account has been suspended.
  This is usually because you have been suspended from Scouting - for example, because your DBS has expired or your mandatory training is out of date - and we will unsuspend your account once we have received notification from headquarters that the issue has been resolved.
  If you are unsure as to why your account has been suspended, or would like to discuss further, please contact the <a href="mailto:members@kswp.org.uk">Membership Coordinator</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Whilst you are suspended, you will not be able to sign up to or attend any KSWP events.
  If you are already allocated to an upcoming event, the <a href="mailto:events@kswp.org.uk">Events Coordinator</a> will be in touch to discuss this with you.
</p>

<p>
  Yours in Scouting,<br />
  KSWP
