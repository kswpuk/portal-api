<p>Hello {firstName},</p>

<p>
  Congratulations, your application to join the Queen's Scout Working Party has been accepted!
  We look forward to meeting you at your first event.
  This e-mail contains a few pointers to get started with the QSWP, so please take a few minutes to read it.
</p>

<h4>QSWP Portal</h4>
<p>
  The <a href="https://portal.qswp.org.uk">QSWP Portal</a> is our online members system, where you can update your details, pay your membership fee, and (most importantly) sign up to attend our events and socials.
  An account has been created for you on the Portal, and the details have been sent to you separately.
</p>

<p>
  As a new member, please log on to the <a href="https://portal.qswp.org.uk">Portal</a> to check your details and pay your membership fee at the earliest opportunity.
	You will then be able to see our upcoming events and sign up to attend them.
</p>

<h4>Membership</h4>
<p>
  As a member of the QSWP, you are expected to attend at least two events a year (although we'd love to see you at more events!).
  You can sign up to events via the QSWP Portal, and we try to ensure there are a wide range of different events available
</p>
<p>
  Your membership fee of &pound;5 covers one year of membership, and we expect you to pay this within 3 months of joining the QSWP.
  If you don't renew your membership at the end of the year, or if you consistently fail to attend two events per year over a number of years,
    then your membership will lapse and you will not be able to attend QSWP events until your membership has been renewed.
  For the two years following your membership lapsing, we will keep your Portal account active and you can renew your membership at any time by paying your membership fee via the Portal.
  At the end of these two years, we will delete your Portal account and if you wish to rejoin you will need to go through the application process again.
</p>
	
<h4>Events and Allocations</h4>
<p>The QSWP attends a range of different events all across the country, and also organises regular social events for it's members.
All of these events are listed on the Portal (new events are added throughout the year as we get requests to support events);
and a summary of some of our regular events can be found on the <a href="http://www.qswp.org.uk/members/events.html">Events</a> page of the <a href="http://www.qswp.org.uk/members/">Member's Area</a> on our website.</p>
	
<p>
  Occasionally, we are limited on how many people are able to attend an event, or the event organisers may put additional constraints on who they want to attend the event (e.g. only those who are under 25).
  For these events, places to attend are allocated using an algorithm that takes into account (amongst other things) previous attendance at events, how long you've been a member, and other criteria set by the organisers.
  Details of the selection criteria for each event can be found on the individual event pages in the Portal.
</p>
	
<p>
  If you register and are allocated to an event, but then drop out at a later date, this may affect your chances of being allocated to oversubscribed events in the future.
</p>

<p>
  If you miss the deadline for registering for an event, then for some events we may be able to add you on afterwards.
  Please contact our <a href="mailto:events@qswp.org.uk">Events Coordinator</a> if you want to see if this is possible, or if you have any other questions about an event.
</p>
	
<p>
  We expect members to attend at least two events a year, but we'd love to see you at more events if you're able to make it!
  The more events you attend, the greater your chance of being selected for an oversubscribed event.
</p>
	
<h4>Uniform and Neckers</h4>
<p>
  The QSWP often represents Scouting at large national events, and as such we expect a high standard of uniform so that we show Scouting in the best light.
  Full details of what we expect can be found in the Uniform section of our <a href="http://www.qswp.org.uk/members/membersGuide.html">Member's Guide</a>.
	Please take particular note of the section regarding which badges are acceptable to be worn.
</p>
	
<p>
  You will be issued with a QSWP necker and a nametape at your first event.
	Additional neckers and nametapes are available to buy via the <a href="https://portal.qswp.org.uk">QSWP Portal</a>, but please note that you do not need to buy your first necker or nametape!
</p>
	
<p>
  For less formal events where uniform isn't appropriate, we generally wear QSWP hoodies or t-shirts so we are still recognisable.
	These are available to purchase online at <a href="http://www.carrielou.co.uk/groups/QSWP">http://www.carrielou.co.uk/groups/QSWP</a>.
</p>
	
<h4>Social Media</h4>
<p>
  We have a public <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NationalQSWP">Facebook page</a>, and a private <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/QSWP1/">Facebook group</a>.
	If you have a Facebook account, please like the page and join the group as it is a useful place to discuss events, ask questions, get to know people, etc.
</p>
	
<p>
  We also have a <a href="https://twitter.com/QSWP_UK">Twitter account</a> and an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qswp_uk/">Instagram account</a> which you can follow.
</p>
	
<h4>Members Guide</h4>
<p>
  There is a lot of information on the <a href="http://www.qswp.org.uk/members/">Member's Area</a> of our website.
	This includes a <a href="http://www.qswp.org.uk/members/membersGuide.html">Member's Guide</a> with more in depth information.
</p>

<p>
  In particular, please be aware of the training requirements listed in the Members Guide.
	These are a national requirement, and if you have another Scouting role then you have probably already done them.
	If you haven't and you need support completing them, please contact the <a href="mailto:members@qswp.org.uk">Membership Coordinator</a> who will be able to point you in the right direction.
</p>
	
<h4>Committee</h4>
<p>
  The QSWP committee is run by the <a href="mailto:manager@qswp.org.uk">QSWP Manager</a>, supported by three co-ordinators: <a href="mailto:events@qswp.org.uk">Events</a>, <a href="mailto:members@qswp.org.uk">Membership</a> and <a href="mailto:money@qswp.org.uk">Money</a>.
</p>
	
<p>

<h4>Mail Archive</h4>
<p>
  Information is regularly sent out by e-mail to our members.
	We recommend that you look through our archive of recent e-mails so you know what is currently going on.

<h4>Data Protection</h4>
<p>
  As a member of the QSWP (or a lapsed member who's account we haven't yet deleted), we hold information about you to enable us to function efficiently.
	You can read more about what information we collect on the <a href="http://www.qswp.org.uk/members/dataPolicy.html">Data Policy</a> page of our Member's Area.

<p>
  Well done for making it to the end of our introductory e-mail - hopefully you now have a basic understanding of how the QSWP works and where you can go for more information.
  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact one of the committee.
