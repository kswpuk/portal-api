  Dear {{name}},
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for applying to join the Queen's Scout Working Party.
  We have received your application, and have contacted the referees you provided to ask them for a reference.
  We cannot process your application further until we have received both a Scouting and a non-Scouting reference, and a reference from someone that has known you for 5 or more years.
  Please ask your referees to respond promptly to the request.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to change your referees for any reason, you can simply forward the following link on to them and ask them to complete a reference form online: <a href="https://{{portalDomain}}/join/{{membershipNumber}}/reference">https://{{portalDomain}}/join/{{membershipNumber}}/reference</a>
</p>
<p>
  If you have any questions regarding your application or the application process, please don't hesitate to get in touch with our membership coordinator, at <a href="mailto:members@qswp.org.uk">members@qswp.org.uk</a>.
  You can also <a href="https://{{portalDomain}}/join/status">check the progress of your application online</a>, to see how far your application has got and which references we are waiting for.

  Many thanks,<br />
