<p>Dear {{name}},</p>

<p>
  Your QSWP Membership has now expired, and your membership status has been changed to <strong>Inactive</strong>.
  As an inactive member, your Compass role will be removed and you will no longer be able to attend any QSWP events.
  You can restore your membership to Active by logging on to the <a href="https://portal.qswp.org.uk">QSWP Portal</a> and paying your membership online.
</p>

<p>
  As an inactive member, we will keep your Portal account open for 2 years.
  At any point during this period, you can pay your membership and become an Active member.
  After 2 years have passed, we will remove your details from our system and you will need to reapply if you wish to join the QSWP again.
  If you wish for us to remove your details before then, please get in touch.
</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with a member of the QSWP Committee.</p>

<p>Yours in Scouting,<br />QSWP</p>
